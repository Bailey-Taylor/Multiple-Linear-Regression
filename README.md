## Results
The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between expenditure per pupil and two predictors: average annual salary for public school teachers and average number of pupils per teacher, using a sample of 50 US states. The hypotheses are as follows: H0: B1 = 0, H1: B1 ≠ 0 and H0: B2 = 0, H1: B2 ≠ 0. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between the variables. The results of the analysis indicate that both predictors were statistically significant in predicting expenditure per pupil (average annual salary for public school teachers, t(47) = 16.03, p < .001, 95% CI [0.16, 0.21]; average number of pupils per teacher, t(47) = -6.96, p < .001, 95% CI [-293.92, -162.17]). The model accounted for 86.06% of the variance in expenditure per pupil (adjusted R2=0.8606), and F(2, 47) = 152.3, p < .001; therefore, the decision was made to reject the null hypotheses. The regression equation is as follows: Y = 2916.81 + 0.91X1 - 228.05X2.
## Conclusion
The results showed that both the average annual salary for public school teachers and the average number of pupils per teacher had a significant effect on the expenditure per pupil. Specifically, for every one dollar increase in the average annual salary for public school teachers, the expenditure per pupil increased by $0.19, holding all other variables constant. In contrast, for every one student increase in the pupil-to-teacher ratio, the expenditure per pupil decreased by $228.05, holding all other variables constant. These findings suggest that policymakers should take both variables into consideration when making decisions about education expenditure. Increasing the average annual salary for public school teachers may lead to improved student outcomes, but it should be done in conjunction with efforts to reduce class sizes in order to avoid diminishing returns in terms of expenditure per pupil.
